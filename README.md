# Foundation Project: Food Price Forecasting

This project is part of the ISB Foundation Term 4 coursework. Our goal is to forecast retail sugar prices using machine learning and time series models using CRISP–ML(Q) Lifecycle Process.

## 📁 Project Files

- `FP EDA.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis of sugar price data.
- `wfp_food_prices_ind.csv`: The dataset from the World Food Programme.
- `FP Mid Review Report_Food Price Forecasting.pptx`: Mid-term presentation slide deck.

## 📈 Objective

- Clean and explore the food price dataset.
- Apply time series models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM).
- Use machine learning algorithms for prediction.
- Evaluate model performance using RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.

## 👥 Team

- Group 14 | ISB Class of Summer 2025

## ✅ Next Steps

- Add final models and results
- Prepare final presentation and documentation
